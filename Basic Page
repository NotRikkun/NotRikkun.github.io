Hello! My name is Christopher Cabonilas, a Software Engineering major
from Nanticoke, PA. I come from the Greater Nanticoke Area high school
and during my senior year, I was captian of the swim team, the woodwind section
leader in our marching band, and in the top percentile of the class of 2020.
In my free time, I enjoy playing a lot of video games and chatting with my friends.


I hope this year I can learn as much as I can about coding.
I want to be able to go out into the world and create something that only I could
come up with.
